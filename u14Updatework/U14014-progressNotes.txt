2014-07-28: (recap) I forgot to push the github changes from the 28th
before restoring the starting snapshot, so there is no log
file. [Lesson learned?]
However, the main result from the 28th is that the debuild of php5
from sources fails. dynamic libraries are not found in the build tree,
the resulting make failure is that php5_conf.ini is not found.

2014-07-29:
- working through building Php5FromSource by hand

apt-get -y install gcc debhelper fakeroot

fakeroot is already the newest version.
fakeroot set to manually installed.
gcc is already the newest version.
[note: gcc and fakeroot are installed when debhelper is installed]
The following extra packages will be installed:
  dh-apparmor libmail-sendmail-perl libsys-hostname-long-perl po-debconf
Suggested packages:
  dh-make apparmor-easyprof libmail-box-perl

- setting up the build by hand required copying the OSF debian/control
  and rules files to the build tree. There seem to be a number of
  differences between the two files.
  I tried just replacing the unixODBC lines with iodbc lines, but the
  debuild failed.
  [too many different variables; starting over and making fewer
  changes]

2014-07-30:
 - woot! built php5 from source by hand, not via php scripts
 - caveats:
   1. do not know if the resulting packages will work
   2. debuild was run with -d to override an odbc dependency
      (not sure where this is yet)
   3. only edited the php5 source "rules" file to replace unixODBC
   with iodbc; did not use the OSF-Installer resources/php5/rules
   file. this needs to be investigated.
   4. debuild ended with a lintian warning about running as root, and
   a GPG signature error (see ...Errors.txt file).
      need to decide on how to handle these exceptions.

   5. NOTE: did not run debuild with the latest Ubuntu 14.04.1 updates!

2014-07-31:
 - built php5 from source w/ iodbc by hand
 - succeeded again with same caveats as those listed for 2014-07-30.
 - did discover the remaining unixodbc dependency
 - updated a standalone build shell script

2014-08-01:
 - built php5 again from source w/ iodbc by hand
 - removed unixodbc dependency from debian/control file
 - updated a standalone php5 build script
 - NOTE: did not "tee" output into a log file (will repeat that next)

 - next steps:
   1. rebuild php5 & packages from source & capture output
   2. replace OSFInstaller/resources/php5 directory contents with build packages
      and attempt to run osf-install via OSFInstaller php scripts.

   3. look at debuild warnings and errors related to GPG signing *and*
      decide what to do about it.

2014-08-02:
 - built php5 from source w/ iodbc using bash script and collecting output log

 - next steps:
   1. replace resources/php5 in the OSF-Installer tree
   2. replace control and rules files in resources/php5
   3. attempt install using built packages

2014-08-03:
 - attempted install using build .deb packages
 - Virtuoso install failed on getting libodbc2 files
   need to start over and repeat.
 - log file saved

 - OSF/Virtuoso error is with apt-get download libiodbc2:
   downloads a "data.tar.xz" file, but OSF script is looking for "data.tar.gz"
   [ not sure how to proceed ]

2014-08-04:
 - Fred's hint on specifying version "3.0" in place of default "3.0.0" enables install to proceed up to downloading core OSF ontologies files.
 - log file saved
