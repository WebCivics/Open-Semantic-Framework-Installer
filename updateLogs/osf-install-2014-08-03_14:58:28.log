You are about to install the Open Semantic Framework.
This installation process installs all the software components that are part of the OSF stack. It will take 10 minutes of your time, but the process will go on for a few hours because of the many pieces of software that get compiled.

The log of this installation is available here: /tmp/osf-install-2014-08-03_14:58:28.log
