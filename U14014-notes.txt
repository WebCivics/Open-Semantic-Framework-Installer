2014-07-28: (recap) I forgot to push the github changes from the 28th
before restoring the starting snapshot, so there is no log
file. [Lesson learned?]
However, the main result from the 28th is that the debuild of php5
from sources fails. dynamic libraries are not found in the build tree,
the resulting make failure is that php5_conf.ini is not found.

2014-07-29:
- working through building Php5FromSource by hand

apt-get -y install gcc debhelper fakeroot
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree

fakeroot is already the newest version.
fakeroot set to manually installed.
gcc is already the newest version.
[note: gcc and fakeroot are installed when debhelper is installed]
The following extra packages will be installed:
  dh-apparmor libmail-sendmail-perl libsys-hostname-long-perl po-debconf
Suggested packages:
  dh-make apparmor-easyprof libmail-box-perl
The following NEW packages will be installed:

[note: warning when downloading php5 source:

- setting up the build by hand required copying the OSF debian/control
  and rules files to the build tree. There seem to be a number of
  differences between the two files.
  I tried just replacing the unixODBC lines with iodbc lines, but the
  debuild failed.
  [too many different variables; starting over and making fewer
  changes]
